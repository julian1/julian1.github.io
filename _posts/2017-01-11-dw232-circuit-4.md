### Testing trimpot temperature sensitivity


It would be desirable to confirm which components are responsible for the ambient temperature sensitivity observed in [part-3](/2017/01/10/dw232-circuit-3.html). 

A heatgun provides a crude way to test the temperature sensitity of the trimpots used as dividers to set voltages for op-amp inputs. 

Using the heatgun on lowest settings and a small nozzle attachment, hot-air is pointed at the trimpot for a 10C rise, and then pulled away to allow the component to cool. Kapton tape helps to shield heat away from board components that are not under test. 

The measurements are derived from a K-thermocouple held against the backside of the trimpot case with a rubber-band. The measurement interval is 10 seconds.

### Current adjust trimpot

Plot showing the temperature rise and fall for the current adjustment trimpot, as well as the strong voltage-reference correlation. The plot reveals a 40uV swing over a 10C (26-36C) change in temperature - or about 4uV/C.

### Temperature setpoint trimpot

Testing the temperature response of the second trimpot shows little identifiable affect on the reference voltage. Here, there is a 12uV swing, which is only a bit higher than the background noise readings. And there is no obvious correlation with temperature. Plots of junction temperature confirm the apparent lower sensitivty of temperature regulation loop to the trimpot tempco.
